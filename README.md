# Manaaki License

The **Manaaki License** is a kaupapa-driven framework for equitable collaboration, grounded in the values of *manaaki* — to support  and care for one another in all relationships, including those involving creative and intellectual work. It is designed for artists, developers, educators, and collaborators who wish to protect the spirit of mutual benefit, cultural respect, and shared stewardship.

## 🌿 Cultural Foundation

In te ao Māori (the Māori worldview), *manaaki* does not simply mean "hospitality". It represents a deep ethic of care, generosity, and reciprocity. It is tied to *mana* (prestige, integrity, personal and collective authority), and to the ancestral understanding that we are all interconnected: through our whakapapa, through whenua, and through the relationships we sustain with others.

> "*To maintain my own mana, I must recognise, uphold and uplift the mana of others.*" – Tania Te Whenua  
> "*You are not an individual – you are a representative of everyone who has gone before you.*" – Dr. Dione Payne

This license brings that ethos into digital and legal domains, reimagining intellectual property as a site of care rather than extraction.

## 📜 Legal Intention

The Manaaki License does not attempt to replace conventional legal systems — but to supplement them with a cultural ethic. It ensures:

- ✍️ **Shared authorship** and attribution
- 🤝 **Mutual agreement** for commercial use
- 🔁 **Shared benefit** from derivative works
- 🛡️ **Cultural integrity**, especially in projects involving indigenous knowledges

The Treaty of Waitangi (Te Tiriti o Waitangi) has become a touchstone for bicultural expression in Aotearoa New Zealand, and while the concept of manaaki is not yet directly codified in law, it is increasingly influential in public discourse and could become legal interpretation.

## 🌟 Key Principles

- **Shared Ownership**: All contributors retain joint ownership of the work.
- **Mutual Consent**: Commercial use and significant modifications require explicit agreement from all contributors.
- **Reciprocity**: Derivative works should continue the chain of care and remain under the same license.
- **Cultural Respect**: The work must not be used in ways that harm or misrepresent cultural concepts, particularly Māori knowledge systems.

## 📘 In Practice

This license was designed for projects that:

- Involve shared authorship and creative co-design
- Blend technical and cultural innovation
- Need protection from unilateral commercial extraction
- Wish to signal care for communities, ideas, and taonga tuku iho (inherited treasures)
